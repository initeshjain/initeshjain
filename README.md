### [SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM - PRACTICAL RESOLVED](https://amzn.to/3v37FAm) 
The book "Server Operating System - Practical Resolved" primarily focused on Practical content and less theory. This book is the form of Server Operating System Notes taught in academic. In this book I used English language with combination of Laymen terms for better understanding. As the Auther of this book and also a Cloud Computing student, I write what I learned in my academics in this book. So Hope after purchasing you will find this helpful.
